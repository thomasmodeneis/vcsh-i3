vcsh-i3
=======
My configuration for the [i3 Window Manager](http://www.i3wm.org).

Required packages
-----------------
* `community/i3-wm`
* `community/i3status`
* `community/ttf-inconsolata` (monospace font used system-wide)

The vcsh-bin repo is also required. Clone with `vcsh clone git@github.com:chookies/vcsh-bin.git`

Optional
--------
community/i3lock (for a neat lockscreen)

Customization
-------------
* In .i3/status.conf: change the `wireless` and `ethernet` names to match your system

You are free to fork and edit to your liking!
